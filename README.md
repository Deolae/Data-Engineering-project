# Data-Engineering-project
Project Steps:
Identify the relevant sources of data, such as CSV files, websites,PDF documents , and texts files . 
Understand the structure and format of the data in each source, and design a data schema that 
accommodates the different data types and relationships.

• Data Ingestion:
Develop a data ingestion module capable of fetching data from CSV files, web APIs, or web scraping 
techniques. For CSV files, implement a mechanism to read and parse the data, handling any 
inconsistencies or missing values. For web sources, utilize libraries or tools to retrieve data from APIs or 
scrape data from web pages.

• Data Transformation and Cleaning:
Design and implement data transformation routines to convert the raw data into a consistent format. This 
may involve cleaning, standardizing, and normalizing the data across sources. Handle any data quality 
issues, such as missing values, outliers, or data inconsistencies.
Web Scraping and Data Extraction:
For web sources, implement web scraping techniques to extract structured data from HTML pages. Utilize 
libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Selenium to navigate web pages, extract relevant data elements, and 
convert them into a usable format for further processing.


• Data Storage and Persistence:
Choose a suitable data storage solution, such as a relational database or a data lake, to store the transformed 
and integrated data. Implement the necessary mechanisms to load the processed data into the chosen 
storage system, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

• Documentation and Monitoring:
Document the pipeline architecture, data workflows, and dependencies. Create clear instructions for 
maintaining and updating the pipeline.

By completing this project, you will have a versatile data engineering pipeline capable of integrating, 
transforming, and persisting data from diverse sources such as CSV files, web APIs, and PDF documents. 
This will enable efficient data analysis, reporting, and decision-making process
